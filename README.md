# Writing a Data Science blog post

Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree 1st Project.


## Installation

libraries needed:
- pandas
- numpy

- seaborn

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires these libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute:

You will need to download Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017 and put in dataset folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017).


## Project Motivation

This is a Udacity Nanodegree project. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Dataset:

1. Which countries are surveyed the least?
2. What are the most popular programming languages?
3. How are job satisfaction ratings in each country?
4. What are the least popular programming languages or KSA?
